# Demographic & Income Analysis – Data Analyst Project (R & Quarto)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of demographic and income data to identify **patterns, disparities, and trends** that can support **business and policy decision-making**.

The analysis examines how **income varies by age, gender, marital status, and ethnicity**, using data visualisation and summary statistics to translate raw data into **actionable insights**.

This project demonstrates core **Data Analyst competencies**, including:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis
- KPI-style summarisation
- Insight generation for business use cases
- Clear and reproducible reporting

## Dataset
The dataset includes demographic and socioeconomic attributes such as:
- Age  
- Income  
- Gender  
- Marital Status  
- Ethnicity  

The data is used for analytical and portfolio demonstration purposes.

## Key Analytical Questions
- How does income change across different age groups?
- Are there noticeable income differences by marital status?
- Do gender-based income gaps exist in the dataset?
- How does income distribution vary across ethnic groups?
- Are there skewed distributions or outliers that could impact averages?

## Key Findings
- Income generally increases with age up to mid-career ranges, then stabilises or declines.
- Married individuals tend to show higher median income compared to single groups.
- Income distributions are positively skewed, highlighting the importance of median-based analysis.
- Differences in income distributions are observed across demographic categories.

## Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following **data-driven recommendations** can be made:

### 1. Targeted Product & Service Segmentation
Businesses can use **age and marital status segmentation** to design targeted pricing, promotions, or financial products aligned with income capacity.

### 2. Fairness & Inclusion Monitoring
Observed income differences across gender and ethnicity suggest the need for **regular monitoring of pay equity** and demographic performance metrics within organisations.

### 3. Smarter KPI Reporting
Due to income skewness, **median income** should be prioritised over averages in dashboards and executive reporting to avoid misleading conclusions.

### 4. Workforce Planning & Policy Design
Public-sector or HR teams can leverage these insights for:
- Workforce compensation benchmarking  
- Social policy evaluation  
- Benefits eligibility analysis  

### 5. Data Collection Improvements
Future analyses would benefit from additional variables such as:
- Education level  
- Employment type  
- Industry sector  

## Tools & Technologies
- **R**
- **Quarto**
- **tidyverse**
- **ggplot2**

## How to Run the Project
